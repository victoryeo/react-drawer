This project is a demo of material UI drawer with router.

The screen is split into two parts. The left hand side shows the
material UI drawer, with the material UI app AppBar as the menu title.
The right hand side shows the screen when you click on the drawer sidebar.

The drawer is made into a permanent sidebar with variant="permanent"
in the Drawer.
